# For What?

This guide outlines how to query JSON data embedded within an application, as opposed to using SQL queries.

**Benefits:**

- **Simplified data access:** When data is readily available within the application itself, querying it directly avoids the need for external databases and SQL setups.
- **Flexibility for future use cases:** Often, examples of JSON data are provided to help us grasp its functionality, allowing us to replicate and comprehend its workings. Subsequently, we can adapt these insights for SQL queries.
- **Easy data portability:** Copying the folder containing the JSON data allows you to seamlessly migrate it to new application versions or environments.
